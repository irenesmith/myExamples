      <p>Just a few small samples I've created for fun and learning. Some are single
        page applications, some are mini-websites, created for the purposes of
        showing a concept or design idea. If you enjoy them, share this site on social
        media.

    <h2>API Examples</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="api_examples/bugzilla/">Bugify</a></dt>
      <dd>
        This little utility allows you to enter the email address that you use
        for your Bugzilla account and retrieve a list of the issues assigned to you.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="games/crag/">Crag</a></dt>
      <dd>
        Similar to Yacht, or Yachtzee, Crag involves throwing dice, three in this
        case, and then scoring the throw in your scoresheet. Because there are
        only three dice and you get only two throws, the game moves much more
        quickly.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="games/yacht/">Yacht</a></li></dt>
      <dd>
        You might know this by a more familiar name. Either way, throw
        five dice. You'll have three attempts to achieve the best score.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>JavaScript Examples</h2>
    <p>
      This section contains general small examples that show you how to do
      one generally useful thing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="jsExamples/modal/">Modal Dialog<a></dt>
      <dd>
        There are times when you need to get information from your user before
        you can let them continue. Perhaps you need a user name or, in the case
        of a game, you might need to know how many people are playing. The
        example on this page shows you how to present a dialog box to the user.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Utilities</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="games/dnd/">Role Playing Utilities</a></li></dt>
      <dd>
        A few utilities for the role-playing fanatic, such as a dice
        throwing utilities. Roll the number and kinds of dice you wish
        with an optional plus or minus. For examples, 3d6+5.
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="utilities/tipster/">Tipster</a></dt>
      <dd>
        When you are at a restaurant and are sharing the bill width
        multiple people, this makes it easy to calculate the tip and
        divide it amongst the diners.
